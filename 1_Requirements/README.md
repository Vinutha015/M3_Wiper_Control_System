# Objective
A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic
wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with
the system. 
# Features
The wiper system consists of a sensor installed on the hood and a controller mounted inside. The controller is connected to the existing wiper switch and motor. Since the automatic wiper is an extension to the existing wiper system,it is easy for the driver to control.
